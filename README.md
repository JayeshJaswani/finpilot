## 💡 Executive Summary
The **AI Business Diagnostic Agent** is a GenAI tool engineered to accelerate the "Discovery Phase" of financial consulting. By leveraging **Google Vertex AI** and **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, the tool ingests complex annual reports and instantly transforms them into structured revenue visualizations, live market intelligence, and actionable strategic recommendations.

It is designed to solve the "Analyst's Bottleneck"—automating the manual spreading of comps and trend detection so consultants can focus on strategy.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 1. 📄 Automated Financial Extraction
* **Ingestion:** Processes consolidated financial statements (PDFs) in <1 minute.
* **Analysis:** Deterministic extraction of Revenue, COGS, OpEx, and Net Income using a custom Gemini Agent.
* **Visualization:** Generates dynamic **Sankey Diagrams** to map capital allocation and operational inefficiencies.

### 2. 📡 Real-Time Market Intelligence
* **Live News Feed:** Integrated with the **AlphaVantage API** to pull real-time press releases, leadership changes, and sentiment updates.
* **Contextual Grounding:** Combines backward-looking financial data (10-K) with forward-looking market news to provide a complete picture of company health.

### 3. 🧠 Strategic AI Analyst
* **Buy/Hold/Sell Logic:** An algorithmic recommendation engine that weighs financial ratios (Liquidity, Solvency) against operational risks to output a preliminary investment rating.
* **Ratio Health Check:** Automated calculation of ROE, Current Ratio, and Debt-to-Equity with industry benchmarking.

### 4. 📤 Enterprise Workflow Integration
* **Export Options:** Instantly download analysis as **Excel (.xlsx)**, **CSV**, or **PDF** reports for seamless inclusion in client presentation decks.

### 5. 📉 Automated DCF Valuation Engine
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Uses a "Judge & Calculator" approach—Gemini extracts qualitative growth assumptions (Bull/Bear/Base cases) from the 10-K, while a deterministic Python engine executes the actual math to prevent hallucination.
* **Formula-Based Export:** Unlike standard tools that dump static numbers, this feature generates an **Excel (.xlsx) file with live formulas** (e.g., `=Previous_Year * (1 + Growth_Rate)`). This allows analysts to audit the model and tweak assumptions manually.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Automatically calculates Enterprise Value and Equity Value per share under varying WACC and Terminal Growth scenarios.

> **New in v2.0:** The tool now builds **Defensible DCF Models**. It doesn't just give you a stock price; it gives you the *working* Excel file with the formulas that generated it, cutting the time to build a preliminary valuation model by 90%.
